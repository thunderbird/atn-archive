# Personas / Lightweight Theme Archive
### June 11th, 2024

This release consists of `personas.csv`, which is a list of personas/lightweight themes that were resided in ATN's database.

While AMO converted almost all the Persona/Lightweight Themes to Static Themes (which are the addons linked in the csv), ATN only converted the top 1000 or so. For completeness `personas.csv` contains the addon name, and a link to the static theme on AMO.

**Note: Not all addon links have been tested, it's possible that some links no longer work.**
